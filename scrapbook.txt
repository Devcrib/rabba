You con dey diet... you wan become Methuselah, ya nuh ready to die yet... A hundred and fifty years is nuh too much - and dat is ur target!

You con dey look fresh... everybody wey know you before don dey envy you small small

You buy Amazon, buy eBay put, con dey feel like a mogul... even Jumia boss sef dey famz you make u sha buy am

You too dey feel fly... nothing is impossible, you convince Beyonce to divorce Jay-z

You no go your own wedding... you too busy, business here-and-there, even ur bae can relate, your father-in-law still call you good boy as you dash am Givenchy

You become small-Jesus, nothing dey vex you again, you don ice ur temper... person bash your new Range, u tell am 'no problem, no one is above mistake'
